## Coding Allstars - Trial Task
I have written and developed this project to apply for a job posting as a Junior PHP Developer in Coding Allstars.

### [Live Version! (Netlify)](https://gorgeous-lollipop-371737.netlify.app/)

### Technologies:
HTML/CSS/JavaScript for design<br>
PHP for translation script

### Project Description:
The task required me to clone the website known as ClassCentral. Then, I must translate all of the scraped pages (one-level deep) into Hindi and have the translations hard-coded into the code. I must also make sure that all of the menues in the home page work as intended for both mobile and desktop screens.
